## What three objects, sounds or movements are you classifying?

Three objects: phone, pen, and cables.


## What makes those interesting to classify? How would you use this in life or in art?

These three objects are some of the objects that I interact with most frequently at school.


## Describe your false positive.  What was incorrectly detected as one of your three classes?

The machine misclassifies an eraser as a phone (False positive for phone category).


## Describe your false negative.  How did your classifier not recognize a class it should have known?

THe machine misclassifies a phone held at vertical as a pen (False negative for phone category).


## How well did the AI do? What seemed to be hard for it? What patterns do you think it was detecting?

The AI is doing quite well at classifying images of these three objects. It is hard for the AI when none of the three objects are in the frame. In my opinion, it is detecting squarish objects, straight objects, and curly objects, that's why the false negative could happen.
